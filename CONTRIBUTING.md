## Bug fixes

Open issues can be found on the package's [GitHub issues](https://github.com/hoangnhan2ka3/twg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) page with a `bug` label.

These are a great place to start contributing to the repo!

Once you start work on a bug, post your intent on the issue itself. This will prevent more than one person working on it at once.

If the bug you want to work on doesn't have a related issue, open one, and attach the `bug` label.

## New features

Before adding any features, open a [Feature Proposal](https://github.com/hoangnhan2ka3/twg/issues/new/choose).

This will let anybody talk through your proposal API and/or implementation before you spend time on it.

## Development

Follow these steps to get your code PR-ready:

1. Fork the `twg` repo.
2. Clone your fork to your local computer.
3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack).
4. Run `pnpm install` in the repo root.
5. Add your code and supporting tests then run `pnpm test` to make sure all tests passed.
6. If this is a feature that requires doc changes, make as necessary.
7. Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Following the existing format.
8. Run `pnpm lint` to make sure your code is linted and formatted properly.
9. You're ready!
