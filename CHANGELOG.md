### Core change

- Use `@babel` AST to parse all conditional classes, objects, arrays or even both string and array.

    - Reduce several complex regex use to parse condition.
    - Lighter bundle.
  - **Cons:**
    - Currently work on _(.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx)_ file only.
    - A bit slower, especially on the first time, when nothing is cached.
    - 4 more dependencies ðŸ˜¢
- Supports native objects behavior like `clsx` (Key as classes and value as conditionals) [[docs](https://github.com/hoangnhan2ka3/twg?tab=readme-ov-file#-news)].
- Refactor lite version of `parser()` function to accept new objects behavior.

### Chore
