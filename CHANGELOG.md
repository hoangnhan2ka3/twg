## [2.0.0] - 2024-08-27

### Core change

- Use `@babel` AST to parse all conditional classes, objects, arrays or even both string and array.
  - **Pros:**

    - Reduce several complex regex use to parse condition.
    - Lighter bundle.

    - Currently work on _(.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx)_ file only.
    - A bit slower, especially on the first time, when nothing is cached.
    - 4 more dependencies ðŸ˜¢
- Supports native objects behavior like `clsx` (Key as classes and value as conditionals) [[docs](https://github.com/hoangnhan2ka3/twg?tab=readme-ov-file#-news)].
- Refactor lite version of `parser()` function to accept new objects behavior.

### Chore

- Add more test cases for new objects behavior.
- Fixed npm README's shields links.
- Bump dependencies version.

### Misc

- Deleted unused `(e)` in catch block of lite version of `replacer()` function.
